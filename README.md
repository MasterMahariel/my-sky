# My Sky

This is a weather app that allows you to find a city's weather information so you can make important decisions from that data. 


## Motivation

My Sky was created to be part of my personal portfolio of apps to show potential clients and employers. As a new developer, having a portfolio is a great way to show your skills and so I created My Sky to showcase what I am capable of making. This particular application helped me gain a deeper understanding of how Angular and TypeScript work together in the development process.  

## Build status

CI/CD will be added once this application is live.

## Code style

I am following the recommended best practices from ESLint, Angular, and TypeScript.
